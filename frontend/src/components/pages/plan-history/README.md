# PlanSmart UI Components

This project contains UI components for the PlanSmart application. 

## Implementation Notes 

### Data Structure
- Models are defined in the `models` directory
- Sample data is provided in the `data` directory
- Components are structured to accept props that match these models

### Components to Implement
1. **PlanHistory** - Main page component
   - State management for selected plan is stubbed out
   - Needs implementation for plan selection

2. **Task Completion**
   - Checkboxes in PlanHistoryMain need onChange handlers
   - Progress bar should update based on completed tasks

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Search input in sidebar needs implementation
   - Should filter both plans and chats

4. **Action Buttons**
   - Share, Export, and Start Over buttons need handlers

### Getting Started
1. Review the component structure and data models
2. Implement the state management for user interactions
3. Connect to real API endpoints when available
